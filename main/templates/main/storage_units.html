        <h3><strong>The Strength of Seagrave</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Seagrave, Canadaâ€™s leading supplier of steel building components, supplies a complete line of MiniStorage
            buildings for the self storage industry. With a focus on quality and value, the design details used in a
            Seagrave MiniStorage building ensure ease of erection by factory locating critical fastening locations and
            by providing pre-cut framing members. From the fasteners to the doors, Seagrave can provide the complete
            building for your self storage needs.

            <h3><strong>Long Lasting. Solid. Attractive.</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Seagrave MiniStorage units are made completely of long-lasting steel to ensure your investment is
                secure. Interior walls are finished using Seagrave DiamondSeal, a low rib wall panel while the exterior
                wall and roof cladding can be either StormSeal or StrucSeal.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Quality and Economy are Built In</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Every MiniStorage project is designed and detailed for your specific application using advanced 3D
                modeling software. This technique ensures accuracy by designing the building in a virtual environment.
                Factory placed holes greatly reduce erection time by eliminating field measuring of critical dimensions.
                This means our MiniStorage building is a bolt together solution using special self-threading structural
                bolts that provide exceptionally strong connections that are simple and efficient to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each MiniStorage building comes with easy to read engineer stamped drawings, erection manual, structural
                steel door openings, partition framing, roof and wall panels and a complete trim package.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Options</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Optional items include doors, gutters and downspouts, ridge vents, and the Seagrave RTL-24 standing seam
                roof system. Protect your investment with the premium RTL-24 concealed fastener standing seam roof
                system. Exterior roofing, siding, and trims come in a variety of stock colours. Optional colours are
                available by special order. Special requirements can be incorporated such as interior hallways,
                firewalls, provisions for climate control, and various shaped building footprints. Seagrave has the
                solution for your mini storage needs.
